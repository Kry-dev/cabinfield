            p
              | We want you to be 100% satisfied with your purchase, and we recognize that there are certain times when it’s “just not right”.  At Cabinfield, we understand that there may be times when, for whatever reason, you may wish to return your purchase, and we want to make sure that the return process is a easy as possible.
            p
              | If you are not completely satisfied, you may return your
              u non-customized
              |  purchase within 30 days of delivery, and we will make a complete exchange for something you prefer or issue you a refund - your choice.  To initiate your return or exchange, please call us toll-free at 866-450-WOOD (9663), or send an e-mail to:
              a(href='mailto:service@cabinfield.com') service@cabinfield.com
              | , and we will provide you with a Return Authorization and our shipping address.  It’s that simple.
            p
              | We are committed to exceeding your expectations, and because we want our customers to be satisfied with their purchase, we never charge restocking fees.  We will give you instructions on how to return, at your expense, any new, undamaged furniture in its original packaging. We will refund the cost of the item, less our shipping and packaging costs (see “Shipping and Packing Costs”).
            p.warning Please note: We cannot refund or exchange any Customized Orders.
            h3#section1-2 Shipping and Packing Costs
            p
              | Shipping and packing fees depend on the destination of an item being shipped.  There are some locations where we do not pass any of the shipping costs onto our Customers, and other where we charge a shipping fee; however, the fee only covers a small portion of our actual shipping costs.  For all items returned (except for Fine Furniture, as discussed below), we will refund the cost of the item, less 15% of the product price or the amount paid by the Customer for shipping (whichever is greater).
            p.note
              | For Fine Furniture returns on orders up to $1,000, we will refund your cost of the item, less, the greater of, 25% of the product price, or the amount paid by the Customer for shipping.  For Fine Furniture returns on orders of $1,001 or more, we will refund cost of the item, less the greater of,  20% of the product price or the amount paid by the Customer for shipping.  The additional cost for Fine Furniture returns is due to the increased cost we incur by having the items professionally packed prior to shipment.
            h3#section1-3 Return Policy for Customized Orders
            p
              | Customized Orders are custom-crafted to your Unique Specifications; therefore, they cannot be returned or exchanged.
            p
              | Should you discover a manufacturing defect with your order, or if your item was damaged during shipping, know that we will go out of our way to make it right.  Our Amish craftsmen have been building furniture for over two decades, and are deeply committed to maintaining the highest standards of craftsmanship.
            h3#section1-4 Damage-Return Policy
            p
              | In the unlikely event that your item was received damaged, rest assured that we will make it right.  To qualify for our Damage-Return Policy, you must contact Cabinfield within one (1) business day of receipt of the item.  Depending on the severity of damage, we will either repair your item or replace it.  The determination of whether to repair or replace an item will be made solely by Cabinfield, and whichever option we deem to be appropriate, your item will look brand new.
            h3#section1-5 Fine Furniture Customized Stains
            p
              | We send out stain samples for our customized Fine Furniture in order to help you decide the stain that will work best for you.  Please be aware that while these samples are excellent approximations, they may vary from the actual stain on the item you receive.  These variations occur naturally as a result of differences in wood grain, type of wood, stain composition, and other naturally occurring factors.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for differences between the sample color and the final color of the stain you choose for your Customized Order.
          #section2.item
            h2 Delivery time
            p
              | Most of Cabinfield's smaller Amish-handcrafted products are filled within a week to ten business days after your order.  Larger products, such as Gazebos and certain lawn furniture orders may occasionally take 4-6 weeks to be ready for delivery. Likewise, our handcrafted Fine Furniture pieces are also typically ready to ship in 4-6 weeks.  In the event that we expect delivery delays on particular pieces, you will be notified before we finalize your order.  Despite our best efforts, we may encounter circumstances beyond our control, and we may not meet our projected delivery schedule. In these rare occasions, we do our very best to fill your order as expeditiously as possible, but we cannot guarantee an exact delivery date and are not responsible for monetary losses that may result from such unexpected delays.

            h2 Order Cancelation
            p

To cancel an order, you must contact Cabinfield directly to inquire as to whether your order has been processed.  Cabinfield, in its sole discretion, will determine whether an order can be cancelled based on whether production has started and/or whether the item has been shipped.  Cabinfield reserves the right to deny all cancellation requests after (1) business day or once the order is processed, whichever occurs first.

            p
              | Custom orders (e.g., a wood species not offered on our site, items built to a custom size, products finished in a custom stain, or items ordered with a custom engraving) are charged a 50% deposit at the time of your order and the balance is charged when we are ready to ship your order.

            h3(id='#section4-2') Credit Card Verification
            p
              | For your protection, Cabinfield has instituted polices related to the use of credit cards.  We have developed these policies with you – our valued customer – in mind.  Please take a moment to read them over.
            p
              | At Cabinfield, we keep our prices low by working hard to prevent fraudulent credit card use.  To that end, we may reject a credit card payment if we detect the presence of certain fraud indicators, or we may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow a credit card as payment for any reason. Whether a credit card is accepted or rejected is not always determined by information provided by the cardholder, and we apologize for any inconvenience for orders where credit card payment is not possible.  For larger purchases, Cabinfield may e-mail you an authorization agreement to sign and return to us (by fax or by e-mail), containing the Terms outlined on this page. Cabinfield may require this signed agreement for any transaction at our discretion. For international orders, Cabinfield may, at its sole discretion, require payment by wire transfer.

            h2 SHIPPING POLICY
            h3#section5-1 Motor Freight Shipping
            p
              | While many of our fine, handcrafted pieces are small enough to be shipped via UPS or FedEx, shipping our larger indoor and outdoor pieces, is far more complex.  To handle the larger items, we have several options ranging from highly specialized furniture movers to common carrier delivery. Since many of our fine, handcrafted pieces are unique and distinctive, we frequently ship all over the continental United States.  We know that process of moving large indoor and outdoor furniture can be challenging, and we work hard to find the best option that will minimize shipping costs and maximize your convenience. The shipping mode that we will use will depend on the furniture and on the destination. Although we do try to minimize shipping costs, please keep in mind that packing furniture for safe transportation and delivery can be expensive; however, proper care is critical to protect your investment.  Trust us, when your piece arrives safe and sound, you’ll be glad we took the time to protect your treasure.
            p
              | When furniture is delivered by truck freight, the shipper will be in touch with you to arrange a date and time for delivery. Please note that if no one is available at the agreed time for delivery, you will likely incur a re-delivery charge from the carrier (note that Cabinfield has no control over the policies of a third party carrier).  If your home is not accessible by delivery truck (e.g., the truck is too large to enter your street), we will transport your furniture to the nearest accessible point. It will be your responsibility to provide pick-up from there and transportation to your home. In the event that the carrier imposes additional remote-delivery charges, we will notify you prior to shipping.  If you live in a remote location and are concerned that such remote-delivery charges may apply, please contact us as soon as possible.
            p
              | When furniture is delivered by common carrier motor freight, it will be your responsibility to move the piece from the rear of the truck.  You will need to make accommodations to assist the driver with unloading, and although most drivers are very accommodating and will help with the unloading (usually for a nominal fee), we cannot guarantee that your driver will be willing to lend a hand.
            h3#section5-2 Specialized Fine Furniture Delivery
            p
              | For an additional fee, Cabinfield offers an Indoor Delivery and Setup option where your furniture will be delivered by specialized furniture movers who will take care of the entire unloading and set-up process.  Please be sure the furniture will fit in the desired room and through all entryways and hallways with a comfortable margin. We are not responsible for any damage that may result from limited maneuverability due to narrow halls, stairwells, doors, etc.   In the event that setup in your desired area is not feasible, the delivery and setup will occur in the closest accessible area (see Special Delivery Preparation section).
            h3#section5-3 Receipt of Your Handcrafted Furniture
            p
              | Please inspect your order carefully when it arrives. Your furniture is insured against freight damage. Please do not sign the Bill of Lading until you are
              b certain
              |  that all your furniture has been delivered in good condition. If you discover any damage, please sign the Bill of Lading with a note describing the damage that you see. Please also notify us
              b immediately
              |  if you discover any damage. We will either arrange to have the furniture repaired or will replace it at no cost to you.  Please refuse the shipment if it has been significantly damaged during shipping.

We make no guarantees about the success or effectiveness of such services.  We are not responsible for damage that may occur to your land during site preparation by Cabinfield or by any independent contractor.

            p
              | It is your responsibility to make sure that your site is level prior to the delivery of a fully assembled Gazebo or Playhouse.

            p
              | If you have selected fully assembled delivery and you do not have sufficient clearance, or if your site is inaccessible because of rocks, trees, fences, etc., then the driver may unload your item as close to the intended site as is possible.
